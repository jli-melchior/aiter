    Perform Group Matrix Multiplication (GMM): out = lhs @ rhs + bias

    lhs rows are divided into G groups. Each group of lhs rows is matrix multiplied with a plane of
    rhs 3D tensor and then stored in a slice of out. In PyTorch parlance, it can be implemented as
    follows for a given group g:
        out[group_start:group_end, :] = lhs[group_start:group_end, :] @ rhs[g] + bias[g]

    The size of each group, and their respective start and end positions are specified by
    group_sizes tensor. For instance, suppose that group_sizes = [3, 2, 4, 1]. In this particular
    case we have 4 groups. The 1st group starts at 0 and ends at 2, the second group starts at 3 and
    ends at 4, the third group starts at 5 and ends at 8, and the fourth and final group consists of
    just the 10th (last) row of lhs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lhs : torch.Tensor
        Left-hand side 2D input tensor. Shape: (M, K).
        lhs data type must be torch.float16 or torch.bfloat16, and must match rhs data type.
        lhs must be on the same device of rhs and group_sizes.
    rhs : torch.Tensor
        Right-hand side 3D input tensor. Shape is (G, K, N) when rhs is non-transposed. When rhs is
        transposed, two physically equivalent metadata layouts are supported: shape (G, K, N) with a
        column-major-like stride, and shape (G, N, K) with a row-major stride. See Implementation
        Notes below for the supported (shape, stride) combinations.
        rhs data type must be torch.float16 or torch.bfloat16, and must match lhs data type.
        rhs must be on the same device of lhs and group_sizes.
    group_sizes : torch.Tensor
        1D input tensor describing group sizes. Shape: (G,).
        group_sizes data type must be torch.int32 or torch.int64, and all its elements must be
        non-negative.
        group_sizes must be on the same device of lhs and rhs.
    bias : torch.Tensor or None, optional
        Optional bias tensor. Shape: (G, N).
        If provided, bias data type must match lhs and rhs data type, and bias must be on the same
        device as other input tensors. Each group g adds bias[g] to the output.
    preferred_element_type : torch.dtype, optional
        Desired data type for output tensor. Default is torch.bfloat16.
        Supported output types are torch.float16 and torch.bfloat16.
    existing_out : torch.Tensor or None, optional
        Preallocated output tensor. Default is None.
        If provided, results are written into this tensor. Otherwise, a new output tensor is
        allocated.
        If provided then it must have shape (M, N), its data type must match preferred_element_type
        and it must be on the same device of other input tensors.
    work_stealing : bool, defaults to False
        Enable work stealing, i.e. dynamic load-balancing where CUs with no assigned tiles "steal"
        the next available tile to be computed.
    config : dict[str, int] or None, optional
        Optional dictionary with kernel metaparameters. If absent, config will be queried from
        internal tuning database.
    grid_dim : positive int or None, optional
        Optional override for GRID_DIM config. It's useful to override it while doing performance
        experiments or launching the GMM kernel in parallel with a comms kernel (reserve some CUs
        for comms).

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        The computed output 2D tensor. Shape: (M, N).
        Output tensor data type is given by preferred_element_type.
        If existing_out is provided then existing_out is also returned.

    Implementation Notes
    --------------------
    - GMM is implemented with a persistent Triton kernel.
    - lhs must be row-major (lhs.stride() == (K, 1)).
    - rhs supports three storage layouts. The two transposed layouts are physically
      equivalent (same memory ordering, K varies fastest, then N, then G); only the
      tensor metadata (shape and stride) differs. Both transposed layouts select
      kernel parameter TRANS_RHS == True and produce identical byte offsets in the
      kernel's pointer arithmetic, so they execute the same code:
        * Non-transposed: shape (G, K, N), stride (K*N, N, 1). Kernel parameter
          TRANS_RHS == False. Useful for the forward pass.
        * Transposed (layout 1): shape (G, K, N), stride (K*N, 1, K). Kernel parameter
          TRANS_RHS == True. The (K, N) sub-matrix per group is column-major.
        * Transposed (layout 2): shape (G, N, K), stride (K*N, K, 1). Kernel parameter
          TRANS_RHS == True. The (N, K) sub-matrix per group is row-major.
      Both transposed layouts are useful for computing the lhs derivative in the
      backward pass while fusing the transposition. The choice between layout 1 and
      layout 2 is purely a metadata preference of the calling code.
    - out must be row-major (out.stride() == (N, 1)).
    - bias must be row-major (bias.stride() == (N, 1)) if provided.

    Perform a Group Matrix Multiplication (GMM) variant: out = lhs @ rhs

    lhs columns and rhs rows are divided into G groups. Each group of lhs is matrix multiplied with
    the respective group of rhs and then stored in a plane of the output 3D tensor. In PyTorch
    parlance, it can be implemented as follows for a given group g:
        out[g] = lhs[:, group_start:group_end] @ rhs[group_start:group_end, :]

    The 't' in the operator name derives from MaxText implementation
    (https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/main/src/MaxText/kernels/megablox/gmm.py),
    which served as the initial inspiration for this one. TGMM differs from GMM in terms of tensor
    shapes. GMM does (M, K) @ (G, K, N) = (M, N) while TGMM does (K, M) @ (M, N) = (G, K, N).

    The 'p' in the operator name means that it is implemented with a persistent kernel. There is
    also the non-persistent variation, which is implemented with a regular kernel. Please take a
    look at nptgmm operator. Both ptgmm and nptgmm implement the same computation, choosing one or
    the other is a matter of performance for the target workload.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lhs : torch.Tensor
        Left-hand side 2D input tensor. Shape is (K, M) when lhs is non-transposed. When lhs is
        transposed, two physically equivalent metadata layouts are supported: shape (K, M) with a
        column-major stride, and shape (M, K) with a row-major stride. See Implementation Notes
        below for the supported (shape, stride) combinations.
        lhs data type must be torch.float16 or torch.bfloat16, and must match rhs data type.
        lhs must be on the same device of rhs and group_sizes.
    rhs : torch.Tensor
        Right-hand side 2D input tensor. Shape: (M, N).
        rhs data type must be torch.float16 or torch.bfloat16, and must match lhs data type.
        rhs must be on the same device of lhs and group_sizes.
    group_sizes : torch.Tensor
        1D input tensor describing group sizes. Shape: (G,).

        non-negative.
        group_sizes must be on the same device of lhs and rhs.
    bias_grad : torch.Tensor or None, optional
        Optional bias gradient output tensor. Shape: (G, K).
        If provided, the kernel will compute the bias gradient and write it to this tensor.
        bias_grad must be torch.float32 (kernel uses atomic_add which requires float32),
    preferred_element_type : torch.dtype, optional
        Desired data type for output tensor. Default is torch.bfloat16.
        Supported output types are torch.float16 and torch.bfloat16.
    existing_out : torch.Tensor or None, optional
        Preallocated output tensor. Default is None.
        If provided, results are written into this tensor. Otherwise, a new output tensor is
        allocated.
        If provided then it must have shape (G, K, N), its data type must match
        preferred_element_type and it must be on the same device of other input tensors.
    accumulate : bool, optional
        Whether to accumulate into existing output tensor values. Default is False.
        If False, output will be overwritten with fresh computation.
        If True, results will be added to existing output tensor values.
    config : dict[str, int] or None, optional
        Optional dictionary with kernel metaparameters. If absent, config will be queried from
        internal tuning database.
    grid_dim : positive int or None, optional
        Optional override for GRID_DIM config. It's useful to override it while doing performance
        experiments or launching the persistent TGMM kernel in parallel with a comms kernel (reserve
        some CUs for comms).

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        The computed output 3D tensor. Shape: (G, K, N).
        Output tensor data type is given by preferred_element_type.
        If existing_out is provided then existing_out is also returned.

    Perform a Group Matrix Multiplication (GMM) variant: out = lhs @ rhs

    lhs columns and rhs rows are divided into G groups. Each group of lhs is matrix multiplied with
    the respective group of rhs and then stored in a plane of the output 3D tensor. In PyTorch
    parlance, it can be implemented as follows for a given group g:
        out[g] = lhs[:, group_start:group_end] @ rhs[group_start:group_end, :]

    The 't' in the operator name derives from MaxText implementation
    (https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/main/src/MaxText/kernels/megablox/gmm.py),
    which served as the initial inspiration for this one. TGMM differs from GMM in terms of tensor
    shapes. GMM does (M, K) @ (G, K, N) = (M, N) while TGMM does (K, M) @ (M, N) = (G, K, N).

    The 'np' in the operator name means that it is implemented with a non-persistent, i.e. regular
    kernel. There is also the persistent variation, which is implemented with a persistent kernel.
    Please take a look at ptgmm operator. Both nptgmm and ptgmm implement the same computation,
    choosing one or the other is a matter of performance for the target workload.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lhs : torch.Tensor
        Left-hand side 2D input tensor. Shape is (K, M) when lhs is non-transposed. When lhs is
        transposed, two physically equivalent metadata layouts are supported: shape (K, M) with a
        column-major stride, and shape (M, K) with a row-major stride. See Implementation Notes
        below for the supported (shape, stride) combinations.
        lhs data type must be torch.float16 or torch.bfloat16, and must match rhs data type.
        lhs must be on the same device of rhs and group_sizes.
    rhs : torch.Tensor
        Right-hand side 2D input tensor. Shape: (M, N).
        rhs data type must be torch.float16 or torch.bfloat16, and must match lhs data type.
        rhs must be on the same device of lhs and group_sizes.
    group_sizes : torch.Tensor
        1D input tensor describing group sizes. Shape: (G,).
        group_sizes data type must be torch.int32 or torch.int64, and all its elements must be
        non-negative.
        group_sizes must be on the same device of lhs and rhs.
    bias_grad : torch.Tensor or None, optional
        Optional bias gradient output tensor. Shape: (G, K).
        If provided, the kernel will compute the bias gradient and write it to this tensor.
        bias_grad must be torch.float32 (kernel uses atomic_add which requires float32),
    preferred_element_type : torch.dtype, optional
        Desired data type for output tensor. Default is torch.bfloat16.
        Supported output types are torch.float16 and torch.bfloat16.
    existing_out : torch.Tensor or None, optional
        Preallocated output tensor. Default is None.
        If provided, results are written into this tensor. Otherwise, a new output tensor is
        allocated.
        If provided then it must have shape (G, K, N), its data type must match
        preferred_element_type and it must be on the same device of other input tensors.
    accumulate : bool, optional
        Whether to accumulate into existing output tensor values. Default is False.
        If False, output will be overwritten with fresh computation.
        If True, results will be added to existing output tensor values.
    config : dict[str, int] or None, optional
        Optional dictionary with kernel metaparameters. If absent, config will be queried from
        internal tuning database.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        The computed output 3D tensor. Shape: (G, K, N).
        Output tensor data type is given by preferred_element_type.
        If existing_out is provided then existing_out is also returned.

    Implementation Notes
    --------------------
    - NPTGMM is implemented with a non-persistent regular Triton kernel.
    - lhs supports three storage layouts. The two transposed layouts are physically
      equivalent (same memory ordering, K varies fastest, then M); only the tensor
      metadata (shape and stride) differs. Both transposed layouts select kernel
      parameter TRANS_LHS == True and produce identical byte offsets in the kernel's
      pointer arithmetic, so they execute the same code:
        * Non-transposed: shape (K, M), stride (M, 1). Kernel parameter
          TRANS_LHS == False.
        * Transposed (layout 1): shape (K, M), stride (1, K). Kernel parameter
          TRANS_LHS == True. lhs is column-major.
        * Transposed (layout 2): shape (M, K), stride (K, 1). Kernel parameter
          TRANS_LHS == True. lhs is row-major over the swapped shape.
      Both transposed layouts are useful for computing the rhs derivative in the
      backward pass while fusing the transposition. The choice between layout 1 and
      layout 2 is purely a metadata preference of the calling code.
    - rhs must be row-major (rhs.stride() == (N, 1)).
    - out must be row-major (out.stride() == (K * N, N, 1)).
